What is a network operating system?

- Provides services to clients via a network.

- Generally references resources elsewhere in the network.

- Optimized for performance.

2
What is the role of an operating system?

To be layer between hardware and users, to reduce the complexity users deal with.

To manage system resources and priorities their use between programs.

The operating system is also responsible for security such as authentication and authorization.

.

5
What is an API?

- Allows programmers to access routines/protocols/resources in a specified manner.

6

- VM is when the OS conceals details about how the hardware is used and works from the user.

- The user is presented with a simpler interface to use.

7
Give two examples of user interfaces and when they are used.

- GUI - Graphical user interface. - Used for less experienced users, they have a simpler learning curve than CLI. - CLI - Command line interface. - Is used for smaller less powerful machines when running a graphical display is not appropriate, or for when automation is in mind.

8

Direct two way communication between user and computer.

User supplies commands and data. User receives the results of processing immediately.

Example: Windows XP/7/8

9
What are the three classification of operating systems?

- Interactive operating systems

- Real-Time operating systems

- Network operating systems

10
What is a real-time operating system?

Inputs are processed in a timely manner so that the output can effect the source of the inputs. Four requirements: - Support non sequential application programs. - They have to deal with multiple events happening in parallel and at unpredictable moments. - They have to process and produce response in a specified time. - Safely critical systems must have fail safe features and guaranteed responses within a specific time.

11
Why would Operating Systems for Embedded systems be different than Operating Systems for GP Computers?

- Embedded systems generally fill a specific purpose, and the OSs can be specialised to fit that.

- Embedded systems can have specific size requirements, so available computing resources can be limited.

12

User interface

Resource Management

Device Drivers

Kernel

Hardware

13
What two processing modes exist within OSs?

Multitasking - implies that application programmers are responsible for parallel running and interaction of applications.

14
What is the difference between Symmetric and Asymmetric multiprocessing?

Symmetric Multiprocessing - OS Is fully decentralized and uses the entire pool of processors, dividing them to complete system and application tasks.

Asymmetric - OS is performed entirely on a single system processor, distributing application tasks amongst other processors.

15
Give two benefits and a draw back of using a GUI.

+ Simple and intuitive for new users

+ Some commands may be simpler to perform in a GUI than in a CLI

 

- GUIs require system resources and more complex hardware than CLIs
